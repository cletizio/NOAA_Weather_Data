# NOAA_Weather_Data
 A Python script that pulls weather data from the NOAA CDO API
 This script can be used to pull the JSON data from the NOAA CDO API for different locations
 It will return the date, location, average maximum temperature, average minimum temperature, average precipitation, and average wind speed for the location
 Currently it is set up to return the information for that states of Michigan and Arizona. 
 Other location information can be found here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#locations
 
 For this to work you need to get a token from NOAA here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token
    Once the token is emailed to you make sure to enter it in API_TOKEN

 The script will save the data in a .csv file for analysis or informational purposes

 Feel free to enjoy use this script, duplicate it, and let me know if you have any interesting finds from it
